## Before You Start

Read the [README](README.md) to understand what Sorokeep does and how it's structured. The short version: Sorokeep monitors Soroban smart contract TTLs and alerts developers before their contract state expires. It's a TypeScript CLI that reads from the Stellar RPC and stores data in local SQLite.

If you want to work on something, check the [open issues](https://github.com/AbdulmalikAlayande/sorokeep/issues) first. If there's no issue for what you want to do, open one and describe the change before writing code. This prevents wasted effort on changes that don't fit the project direction.

For how the pieces actually work together at runtime (the daemon cycle, fault isolation, where a new alert channel or command plugs in), read [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). The [Project Structure](#project-structure) section below covers the directory layout; ARCHITECTURE.md covers the data flow.

If you're reporting a security issue (key leakage, unintended transactions, signature bypass), see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead of opening a public issue. This project is also governed by a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Quick Start

You need:

- Node.js 22 or later
- npm
- Git

Clone and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdulmalikAlayande/sorokeep.git
cd sorokeep
npm install
```

Verify everything works:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run the CLI
npx tsx src/index.ts --help

# Watch a real contract on testnet (optional, requires internet)
npx tsx src/index.ts watch CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC --network testnet --name "XLM Test"
```

If all tests pass and the CLI prints its help screen, you're ready.

**Key architectural rule:** core logic never depends on CLI or presentation code. The `commands/` layer is a thin wrapper that calls functions from `core/`, which do all the real work. This means the daemon can reuse the same core functions without importing CLI code.

If you're adding a new feature, the logic goes in `core/`, the CLI wiring goes in `commands/`, and tests go in `tests/core/`.

## Development Workflow

### Test-Driven Development

We enforce strict test-driven development. Your PR will not be accepted without comprehensive tests.

The process is:

1. **Write the test first.** Define what the function should do, what inputs it takes, and what outputs it returns. Run the test — it should fail (red).
2. **Write the minimum implementation** to make the test pass (green).
3. **Refactor if needed**, then run all tests to make sure nothing broke.

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Specific file
npx vitest run tests/core/monitor.test.ts

# Watch mode (re-runs on file changes)
npx vitest

# With coverage
npx vitest run --coverage
```

All tests use in-memory SQLite databases and mocked RPC responses — no network calls, no filesystem side effects.

### Running the CLI During Development

Use `tsx` to run TypeScript directly without compiling:

```bash
npx tsx src/index.ts watch <contractId> --network testnet
npx tsx src/index.ts --help
```

### Database

Sorokeep uses SQLite stored at `~/.sorokeep/sorokeep.db`. The schema is in `src/db/schema.sql`.

Tests use an in-memory SQLite database (`getDatabaseForTesting()`) so they're fast and don't touch your local state.

If you need to reset your local database during development:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
rm ~/.sorokeep/sorokeep.db

# Windows PowerShell
Remove-Item "$HOME\.sorokeep\sorokeep.db"
```

### Linting and Type Checking

```bash
# Lint
npm run lint

# Type check (without emitting files)
npx tsc --noEmit
```

Run both before pushing to ensure CI passes.

## Code Conventions

### TypeScript

- Strict mode is on (`strict: true` in tsconfig)
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is enabled — array access returns `T | undefined`
- ESM modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json). See [ADR-002](docs/adr/ADR-002-use-esm-modules.md).
- Use `import type` for type-only imports
- No `console.log` in core logic — use the pino logger for operational logging, and return data for the CLI layer to print

### Naming

- Files: `kebab-case.ts`
- Functions: `camelCase`
- Interfaces/Types: `PascalCase`
- Database columns: `snake_case`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for true constants, `camelCase` for configuration

### Imports

Order imports by:
1. Node.js built-ins (`node:fs`, `node:path`)
2. Third-party packages (`vitest`, `better-sqlite3`, `commander`)
3. Internal modules (`../../src/core/monitor.js`)

Use explicit `.js` extensions for internal imports (ESM requirement). Type-only imports use `import type`.

### Error Handling

Catch errors and return structured results (like `WatchResult`) instead of throwing from core functions. Let the CLI layer decide how to present errors.

```typescript
// Core function returns a result type, doesn't throw
function doSomething(input: string): { ok: true; value: number } | { ok: false; error: string }
```

### Commits

Follow conventional commit format:

```
feat: add slack alert integration
fix: handle archived WASM entries in monitor cycle
test: add boundary tests for TTL threshold detection
docs: update README with daemon usage
refactor: extract RPC response mapping into helper
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `docs`, `refactor`, `chore`

### Branches

```
feature/short-description
fix/short-description
docs/short-description
```

Branch from `main`, PR back to `main`.

## Architecture Decision Records

Significant design decisions are documented as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in [docs/adr/](docs/adr/). Each ADR explains the context, options considered, and rationale for the chosen approach.

| ADR | Title | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| [ADR-001](docs/adr/ADR-001-use-sqlite-for-local-storage.md) | Use SQLite for Local Storage | Why SQLite over PostgreSQL or JSON files |
| [ADR-002](docs/adr/ADR-002-use-esm-modules.md) | Use ESM (ECMAScript Modules) | Why ESM over CommonJS |
| [ADR-003](docs/adr/ADR-003-use-commander-js-for-cli.md) | Use Commander.js for CLI Framework | Why Commander over oclif or yargs |
| [ADR-004](docs/adr/ADR-004-polling-daemon-architecture.md) | Polling Daemon Architecture | Why polling over event-driven |
| [ADR-005](docs/adr/ADR-005-use-typescript-over-rust.md) | Use TypeScript (Not Rust) | Why TypeScript over Rust for this tool |
| [ADR-006](docs/adr/ADR-006-in-memory-sqlite-for-testing.md) | In-Memory SQLite for Testing | Why tests use in-memory databases |

Before making a significant new design decision, write an ADR. This helps future contributors understand why things are the way they are.

## E2E Sandbox Testing

We provide a complete guide for setting up an end-to-end sandbox environment with a local Stellar network using Docker. See [docs/e2e-sandbox.md](docs/e2e-sandbox.md) for:

- Running a local Soroban-enabled Stellar network
- Creating and funding test accounts
- Deploying test contracts
- Configuring Sorokeep to monitor local contracts
- An automated E2E test script for CI usage
- Troubleshooting common issues

The sandbox lets you test Sorokeep against a real Stellar RPC without touching public testnet or mainnet.

## What Makes a Good Contribution

### Good First Issues

If you're new to the project, look for issues tagged `good first issue`. These are typically:

- Adding a new alert channel (e.g. Matrix, Microsoft Teams, email) — see [docs/adding-an-alert-channel.md](docs/adding-an-alert-channel.md), it's a self-contained plugin registration, not a core change
- CLI UX improvements (better error messages, colored output)
- Documentation improvements
- Adding test coverage for edge cases

### Larger Contributions

For anything beyond small fixes, open an issue first to discuss the approach. This is especially important for:

- New CLI commands
- Database schema changes
- Changes to the monitor cycle logic
- New RPC client methods

## Getting Help

If you're stuck or have questions about the codebase, open an issue or reach out on X ([@The_good_man02](https://twitter.com/The_good_man02)). We'd rather answer questions early than review a PR that went in the wrong direction.
